This module is mainly aimed at understanding the underlying sentiment of a statement. 
First, NLP is used in basic preprocessing of the data. Once the preprocessin is completed, the sentence is classified into one of the following types:

1. Statement/ Declarative Sentence
2. Question/ Interrogative Sentence
3. Exclamation/ Exclamatory Sentence
4. Command/ Imperative Sentence

Underlying Concepts:
Any sentence comprises of two major parts: Subject and Predicate. (Exception being in the Imperative Sentences where the subject is left out or 'YOU' is understood to be the subject). Phrase is a group of words that define a portion of a sentence typically forming a component of a clause. Clause is part of a sentence which has both and subject in it.

Words are divided into different kinds of classes, called Parts of Speech. 
1. Noun - is a word used as the name of person, place, or thing.

3. Pronoun - is a word used instead of a noun. 
4. Verb - is a word to express an action or state. 
5. Adverb - is a word used to add something to the meaning of a verb, an adjective or another adverb. 
6. Preposition - is a word used with a noun or pronoun to show how person or thing denoted by noun or pronoun stands in relation to something else. 
7. Conjunction - is a word used to join words or sentences. 
8. Interjection - is a word which expresses some sudden feelings.
